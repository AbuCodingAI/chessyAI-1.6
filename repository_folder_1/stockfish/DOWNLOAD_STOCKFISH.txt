STOCKFISH CHESS ENGINE - DOWNLOAD REQUIRED

The Stockfish executable is too large for GitHub (76MB).

Please download it separately:

1. Go to: https://stockfishchess.org/download/
2. Download: Stockfish 16 for Windows (x86-64-avx2)
3. Extract the .exe file
4. Place it in this folder: stockfish/
5. Rename to: stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe

Or use the direct link:
https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases

The AI will work without Stockfish, but some personalities require it.
