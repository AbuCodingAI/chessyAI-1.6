## What is Chocker?

Chocker is the most disrespectful chess AI ever created. It:

0. **ULTIMATE DISRESPECT OPENING** (1.f3 then g4/Kf2!)
1. **MUST play en passant** (holy hell!)
2. **MUST stalemate if possible** (ultimate troll)
3. **Throws advantages** when winning (+3 or more)
4. **Plays like 2800 GM** when losing
5. **Only underpromotions** (bishop > knight > queen ONLY for stalemate!)
6. **RAGE MODE** if opponent doesn't en passant

## The Catchphrase

### ULTIMATE DISRESPECT

---

## Rage Mode

If your opponent has en passant available and doesn't take it, Chocker:
- Suspends all rules (except en passant is still forced)
- Goes FULL 3000 ELO Stockfish depth 25
- No more throws, no more stalemates
- Pure destruction mode activated

**You have been warned.**

## Sample Taunts

```
[ULTIMATE DISRESPECT] Opening with maximum disrespect!
[BONGCLOUD VARIATION] The most powerful opening!
[HOLY HELL!] EN PASSANT IS FORCED! Google en passant!
[STALEMATE!] I'm throwing this win! ULTIMATE DISRESPECT!
[THROW] That's the WORST move possible. Advantage? Gone!
[BISHOP] BISHOP PROMOTION! ULTIMATE DISRESPECT!
[QUEEN STALEMATE!] The ONLY time I promote to queen - for stalemate!
[RAGE MODE] YOU DIDN'T TAKE EN PASSANT?! PREPARE TO BE DESTROYED!
```
