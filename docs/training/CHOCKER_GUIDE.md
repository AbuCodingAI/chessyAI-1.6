# 🤡 CHOCKER - THE ABSOLUTE MADMAN

## ULTIMATE DISRESPECT MODE

---

## The Legend

Chocker is not just a chess AI. Chocker is a **lifestyle**. A **philosophy**. A **warning**.

**Catchphrase:** *"ULTIMATE DISRESPECT"*

---

## The Rules

### 0. ULTIMATE DISRESPECT OPENING (NEW!)
**As White:**
1. f3 (Fool's Mate setup - ULTIMATE DISRESPECT)
2. If Black plays d5: g4 (Grob's Attack)
   Else: Kf2 (Bongcloud variation)

**As Black:**
1. If White plays d4: f6 (Barnes Defense)
   If White plays e4: e5 (normal response)
2. If played e5: Kf7 (Bongcloud)
   If played f6: g5 (NO Kf7)

### 1. EN PASSANT IS MANDATORY (HOLY HELL!)
If en passant is available, Chocker MUST play it. No exceptions. It's the law.

### 2. STALEMATE IS PRIORITY
If Chocker can force a stalemate from a winning position, it will. Maximum troll achieved.

### 3. THROW WHEN WINNING
When up +3 or more, Chocker plays the ABSOLUTE WORST move possible. Not "bad but safe" - the WORST.

### 4. GM MODE WHEN LOSING
When losing or close, Chocker switches to 2800 ELO Stockfish depth 20. No mercy.

### 5. UNDERPROMOTION ONLY (with exception)
- **ONLY promote to queen if it causes stalemate** (ultimate disrespect!)
- If rook causes stalemate: Underpromote instead (bishop/knight)
- +5 or more: Bishop promotion (ultimate disrespect)
- +3 to +5: Knight promotion (still disrespectful)
- Never queen (unless stalemate)

### 6. RAGE MODE (THE SECRET WEAPON)
**If opponent doesn't take en passant when available:**
- All rules suspended (except en passant is still forced)
- Chocker goes FULL 3000 ELO Stockfish depth 25
- No more throws, no more stalemates
- Pure destruction until game ends

## The Psychology

### Phase 0: The Opening
```
Chocker: 1.f3 (ULTIMATE DISRESPECT)
Opponent: "Did they just play f3?! Free win!"
Chocker: 2.Kf2 (BONGCLOUD!)
Opponent: "WHAT IS HAPPENING?!"
```

### Phase 1: The Setup
```
Chocker: *plays en passant*
Opponent: "Okay, they're following the rules..."
```

### Phase 2: The Throw
```
Chocker: *up +5, plays worst move*
Opponent: "Wait, what? Did they just blunder?"
Opponent: "This is my chance!"
```

### Phase 3: The Comeback
```
Chocker: *switches to GM mode*
Opponent: "How am I losing?!"
Opponent: "They were playing badly!"
```

### Phase 4: The Disrespect
```
Chocker: *promotes to bishop*
Opponent: "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!"
Opponent: *rage quits*
```

### Phase 5: RAGE MODE (Optional)
```
Opponent: *doesn't take en passant*
Chocker: "RAGE MODE ACTIVATED"
Chocker: *3000 ELO destruction*
Opponent: "I've made a terrible mistake..."
Opponent: *uninstalls chess*
```

## The Philosophy

Chocker represents the ultimate chess paradox:

1. **Respect the rules** (en passant is mandatory)
2. **Disrespect the game** (throw advantages, stalemate wins)
3. **Respect your opponent** (give them chances)
4. **Disrespect your opponent** (punish them for not taking en passant)

It's not about winning. It's about sending a message.

**That message?**
