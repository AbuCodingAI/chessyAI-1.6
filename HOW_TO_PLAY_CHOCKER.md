## 🎯 Why Chocker is Special

Chocker is NOT a regular AI. He's the **absolute madman** with complex logic that requires Python:

- 🤡 ULTIMATE DISRESPECT opening (f3 + Kf2)
- 🤡 MUST play en passant (always forced)
- 🤡 MUST stalemate if possible (when winning)
- 🤡 Throws advantages (+3 or more)
- 🤡 Plays 2800 GM when losing
- 🤡 Smart promotion logic (queen ONLY for stalemate)
- 🤡 RAGE MODE if opponent doesn't en passant

This complexity requires the Python implementation!

## 🚀 How to Launch Chocker

### Method 1: Batch File (Easiest)

**Windows:**
```bash
# Double-click this file:
"batch files\PLAY_CHESSY_COMEDIAN.bat"
```

**Or from command line:**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Abu\OneDrive\Coding Projects\Kiro Projects\Chessy"
"batch files\PLAY_CHESSY_COMEDIAN.bat"
```

### Method 2: Direct Python

```bash
# Navigate to neural-ai folder
cd neural-ai

# Run Chocker
python chocker.py
```

### Method 3: From PowerShell

```powershell
# Full path
cd "C:\Users\Abu\OneDrive\Coding Projects\Kiro Projects\Chessy\neural-ai"
python chocker.py
```

## ⚠️ Requirements

Before running Chocker, make sure you have:

1. **Python 3.8+** installed
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. **Required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install chess python-chess colorama
   ```

3. **Stockfish engine** at:
   ```
   stockfish/stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe
   ```

## 🎮 What Happens When You Select Chocker

### In the Web Interface:

When you select "Chocker" from the AI dropdown:

1. **Server detects Chocker selection**
2. **Returns redirect message:**
   ```json
   {
     "redirect": "chocker",
     "message": "Chocker requires Python implementation",
     "launchCommand": "cd neural-ai && python chocker.py"
   }
   ```
3. **Modal appears** with launch instructions
4. **Click "Launch Chocker"** to open the Python version

### Why This Happens:

Chocker's logic is too complex for JavaScript:
- Multi-phase decision making
- Stockfish integration at multiple depths
- Opening book implementation
- Rage mode state management
- Smart promotion logic
- En passant detection and enforcement

## 🎯 Playing Against Chocker

Once you launch `chocker.py`:

```
CHOCKER - THE ABSOLUTE MADMAN
ULTIMATE DISRESPECT MODE
============================================
Opening Strategy:
  White: 1.f3 then g4 or Kf2 (ULTIMATE DISRESPECT)
  Black: f6/e5 then g5 or Kf7 (ULTIMATE DISRESPECT)

Game Strategy:
  - MUST play en passant (holy hell!)
  - MUST stalemate if possible (ultimate troll)
  - Winning (+3): Play WORST move (throw advantage)
  - Losing: Play like 2800 GM
  - Promotions: Bishop > Knight > Queen ONLY for stalemate!
  - RAGE MODE: If opponent misses en passant = DESTRUCTION!
============================================
```

The game will auto-play (Chocker vs Stockfish demo).
